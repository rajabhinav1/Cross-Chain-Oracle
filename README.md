# Cross-Chain-Oracle
project is about working with real live data from the Blockchain API in a secure way.The product is still in the testing and integration phase, you can go through the preview

Key Features: ( Some features still to be updated)

Live Cryptocurrency Price Data:

The oracle collects real-time cryptocurrency price data from various sources, including reputable exchanges and data providers. It stores historical price data for reference and analysis. Users can request the current price of a specific cryptocurrency or historical price data within a defined timeframe. Node Queries with Metadata:

The oracle facilitates queries to nodes within a blockchain network or multiple networks. Queries can include a range of functions, such as fetching block information, transaction details, smart contract data, or specific blockchain metadata. The oracle supports multiple query types, including read and write operations. Metadata is attached to queries to provide additional context or instructions to the nodes. Multi-Blockchain Support:

The oracle is designed to be blockchain-agnostic, allowing users to query multiple blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, or custom networks. Users can select the target blockchain for their queries. Data Aggregation and Consensus:

For live cryptocurrency price data, the oracle aggregates data from multiple sources to ensure accuracy. Consensus mechanisms are employed to validate the accuracy of data collected from various sources. Customizable Data Feeds:

Users can customize data feeds according to their specific requirements. They can set parameters for data aggregation, data source preferences, and metadata inclusion. Decentralized Node Network:

The oracle operates as part of a decentralized network of nodes or validators. Nodes validate and execute queries while maintaining high availability and redundancy. Data Quality Control:

Data quality control mechanisms are in place to filter and validate data, preventing erroneous information from affecting the blockchain. Security Measures:

The oracle employs robust security measures to protect against data manipulation and malicious attacks. Data is cryptographically signed to ensure integrity and authenticity. Governance and Upgrades:

A governance mechanism allows token holders or stakeholders to participate in decision-making regarding upgrades, parameter changes, and maintenance. User-Friendly Interface:

Users can interact with the oracle through a user-friendly web interface or API. Querying and data retrieval are straightforward for both developers and non-developers.
